# Python_RandData
A little script that I made specifically to get and manage highly random data.

The biggest reason that I am even publishing this is because of the contents of beacomMaster.bin, which took MANY HOURS to request all that data from the nist randomness beacon in the manner done in this script for reasons explained in the script.
I don't want anyone else to have to wait that long, which is why I'm publishing it.
